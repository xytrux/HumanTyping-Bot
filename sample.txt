Beneath the amber glow of the setting sun—the horizon fractured into a mosaic of vivid hues, each one bleeding seamlessly into the next. The whispering breeze wove through the ancient oaks—carrying with it the subtle fragrance of damp earth and distant rain. A solitary nightingale’s melodic aria pierced the tranquil dusk—its notes lingering like fragile echoes of forgotten dreams. In that ephemeral moment—time unraveled, surrendering the world to a serene stillness that felt both eternal and fleeting.
